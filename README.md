# Buildathon 2024: Women Ventures

Our idea, named women ventures, was developed as a part of INFORMATYKA 4.0. The buildathon was conducted offline with a duration of 4 hours to create and deploy a website.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop a web application that aims to work on increasing Women Empowerment: Unlocking Potential, Building Confidence, and Creating Opportunities for Women to Shape Their Futures.

# OUR SOLUTION:
We aimed to create a website where middle aged women can monetise their hobbies by selling on our platform. Afterwards, they can also hire other women who are interested to collab in creating a company or group hobby.
